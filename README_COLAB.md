# Google Colaboratory
Google Colaboratory (short: "Colab") is an online tool for colaborating on writing code, saving and executing it.

Colab is a simple and cheap way to access GPU VM. It allows to create Python 3 Jupyter Notebooks stored on Google Drive while it's user interface is similiar to Jupyter's.

## How to get started

**Connecting Colaboratory to Google Drive**

1. Go to New -> More -> Connect More Apps

2. Search for Colaboratory

3. Click the Install Button

  

**Create Jupyter Notebook**

To create a new Jupyter Notebook go to **New -> More -> Google Colaboratory**.

By default the runtime is CPU only, but can be changed by selecting
**Runtime -> Change Runtime type -> Select "GPU" in the hardware accelerator -> Save**

  

**Sharing your notebook**

A big advantage of Colab is to work together with others on one project.

Therefore you can go to <i class="icon-file"></i> **Share** and choose between creating a sharing-link or inviting your colleagues directly by typing in their Google-Mails.

## Structure

Colab notebooks allow you to combine **executable code** and **rich text** in a single document, along with **images**, **HTML**, **LaTeX** and more.

You can easily add new code or text by selecting **+Code** or **+Text** at the top of the document.

## Restrictions

Altough Google Colab gives you a lot of opportunities there are some restrictions you have to consider while working with it:

- only five notebooks per runtime

- should not be used for long-running background computations

- should not be used for cryptocurrency mining

- web interface automatically disconnects from Colab Runtime after **~30min**
